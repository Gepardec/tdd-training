# Testing Training

This repository is built into 4 different modules that you can work through however your want.
If you completely make your way through it, you will gain knowledge about testing in general and different frameworks that are commonly used in combination with tests.

The modules are generally based on Java 11 (download [here](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download)) and Maven 3.6.3 (download [here](https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/))
